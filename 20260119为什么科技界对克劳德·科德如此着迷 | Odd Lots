- [02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=140s) 有一天，你的卡车突然抛锚了，那真是你人生的一个转折点，你从此彻底改变了。 your life and went in a new direction. So talk to us about what happened that day in the truck, what was going through your mind and how it led to the unstoppable process. Oh, thank you for that. So I think you're referring to the day where I broke down in tears. Mhm. Yeah.
- [02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=167s) So, I had left teaching and went into, you know, payroll sales and, you know, I had my first child and I wanted to be able to provide a better life for him, right? More money, more more opportunities to do things and provide experiences. And man, the first 90 days, it was just so bad. I was so terrible at it.
- [03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=185s) It was like walking into from door to door that I just sometimes I was just stuck. I couldn't get a word out and I was just embarrassed. And I started getting this type of anxiety to where I would pull up to an office or a place of business and I literally could not get out of the vehicle. I was so terrified of something that wasn't going to even kill me.
- [03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=206s) But how I was defining it, it was so big and large. And so I found myself driving around my territory and then I parked at a grocery store and it was pouring down rain in Marco Island, Florida and I literally broke down.
- [03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=228s) I was like, I can't do this anymore and I just need to quit this and I need to go back to doing what I was really good at, which which was coaching baseball. And the only way to coach baseball was to teach school, right? So, it was like a vehicle to get to do what I wanted to do. And so, I went into my good friend Dan Tupperella who was my who was my boss at the time. It's funny enough, I just hired him to work for us.
- [04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=246s) So, he starts Monday, but funny how the Dave will stern. Yeah, it's great, isn't it? Uh, and and I just said to him, "Hey, this isn't for me. You know, I I'm going to go back to do what I what I know best. Like, I just can't do this anymore. I'm terrible. I'm sorry.
- [04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=263s) " And he looked at me and he said, "You know what? I told you I was going to give you a year and you're going to do the same thing for me." I was like, "Buddy, like I I can't do this. I can't live a year like this." He's like, "Well, you have a decision to make, man, because one day your son's going to ask you, "Why did you stop working at paychecks? What are you going to do? Tell him quit?" I was like, "Wait a second. You're on to something here.
- [04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=278s) " So that evening I decided to really get introspective and understand why I wasn't doing well. And and the overarching theme was I wasn't prepared enough. I didn't have a plan. I didn't have a strategy. I was just getting in my truck and just boopping around the community trying to get business.
- [04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=298s) And so I just literally started taking notes every single day and I made commitments of what zip codes I was going to be in every single day. And I predetermined where I was going to stop. think thought of some things that I was going to bring up and talk about. Even it was just going to say, "Hey, I'm Sean French. I'm your rep. I just wanted to say hello. I don't know if there's a need here, but I would love to explore it if there is.
- [05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=317s) " And from that day on, I caught fire. I just exploded that month and the month after and the month after and the month after. And it was five years of that. Literally five years. Then I went into the medical industry and did the same thing until I was tired of it until where, you know, this came up.
- [05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=336s) the podcast came up and I'm like, I've got to go all in on this and I took the principles that I use here from my early days at Paycheck. So, that that day literally built me in that career and then in my next venture into medical and it's what I apply here every single day.
- [05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=357s) H I love how you explained the being tactical like a lot of sales um is sort of bottoms up strategy like the more emails that you send the more opportunities that you get the more likely that things will close. But what was going on mentally for you at that time? Like what was the mental shift that you had to go through to you know double triple your sales and become a top 1% salesperson? What story did I want to tell my son? you know what did I what what how did I want to lead? So for me it was the he dangled the carrot because he knew how much I love being a father. He knew how
- [06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=391s) much I love my son. He was I think about a year at the time. He's like are what are you going to tell your kid or your future kids you know that you quit something? And so for me that that mindset shift for me it was it was immediate.
- [06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=409s) It's like there's no way on God's green earth am I ever going to tell my children that I quit doing something because it was hard. Yeah. So, you have a quote that you say, "People buy people, not products." Talk to us why authenticity in sales really matters. I think people need to like you, right? They got to understand that they can be comfortable around you, that you're not going to judge them for certain things that they say.
- [07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=428s) You know, in sales, it's it's it's really big because let's face it, paychecks may not have been the best product out there all the time. It may not have been the cheapest, but when people make emotional buys, they buy the person that they're working with because they feel comfortable, they like them, or they can trust them.
- [07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=447s) And so, I've taken those same principles into the podcasting career is what I do now 100% of the time. And it's just really what it is. People people listen to the show because they either like me or they stumbled into me and they stay or leave for either not liking me or really liking the authenticity piece of it, which is the latter part of your question. In a world where everybody's talking about being authentic, I pride myself on actually being authentic.
- [07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=473s) And I'm going to show up how I show up and I'm going to say what I feel, but I'm also going to do it with empathy. And I think that is the main difference is like how can you show up like this every day? And then I just realized all this like I'm just going to be me. I'm not going to try to be somebody else. I'm not going to try to be you. I'm going to be how I feel I am.
- [08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=492s) And of course there's different growth patterns and stages of every individual. But for me it's just about living your truth. And I think that shines through with everything that I do. When you say living for me, how do you define what that is? like do you have core values that you stick by? Um you know how do you make sure that you always act how you want to act and represent yourself? So first and foremost family you know family is at the forefront of my mind. My wife and my three children and I always want to represent them well. And
- [08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=523s) so for me that is my initial temperature gauge. Am I representing my wife and my children well right now? And if I am okay I'm gonna keep doing that. But but I that's really my only gauge. And then also, I mean, it's it's pretty simple, but I like to keep things simple because if I start getting complicated with things, I can get lost.
- [09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=548s) My ADHD kicks in and I'm gone, right? So, I really focus on what can I control? I can control how I show up. I control my attitude and I control my effort and that's it. What's up, young and profits? I remember when I first started YAP, I used to dread missing important calls.

You had this awesome sales career and then you pivoted into creating your personal brand with this podcast, with writing a book.
- [11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=703s) Why did you make that change? What made you want to become a creator, entrepreneur, and put your face out there? I didn't. I I did I like like seriously I did not want to. So, it was about 2020, I think 2021. I think it was about 2020. And my wife and I got approached by a good friend of mine to go to this direct sales company called Melleuca.
- [12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=729s) And they said, "Well, if you're going to sell this stuff, you'd be really good at it, but you need to have a personal brand." And I go, "Well, I'm not an inventor. I don't have a product. I don't What are you talking about?" I didn't even know what it was, right? She's like, "Well, no, like what do people say about you? What's your brand?" I go, "I don't know. I have no idea." So, I was a hard case study for her. And she goes, "Well, look, this is what we're going to do.
- [12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=748s) We're going to post a p you post a picture of yourself on your stories and then make a question box, right? It says, "What's the first word you think of when you see me?" And that scared me. First of all, I only had like 700 followers at the time. I didn't know what a question box was. That was a heavy lift for me and it was scary.
- [12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=767s) And so my friends had some choice funny words, right? Like you have a stupid hat on or some other derogatory comments, but the the main theme was leader, coach, determined, determined, determination. So there's this massive response of some derivative of the word determined. And so I went back to her with that information and she said, "Okay, great. Now make a Facebook group.
- [13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=793s) " I called, "What? Like just call determined? Like who's going to want to go to that?" She goes, "No, like you find ways to create the name of the Facebook group based on your personal brand." I'm like, "So you're telling me my brand is determined?" And she goes, "Yes, that's what people say about you. That's what your brand is.
- [13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=812s) How people view you is who you are to an extent, right?" So I said, "Okay, I don't get it. I I don't get it. I don't understand it." She got frustrated and said, "Sean, what in the world do you want out of life?" I go, "Honestly, you know what? I want to wake up in a society where they're deter where people wake up determined to chase their dreams no matter how they feel emotionally at that time." She goes, "Determined society." I go, "I don't like it.
- [13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=835s) " She go, I said, "It's missing something." I said, "It's missing the word 'the'. So, let's go the determined society." She goes, "Great. Make your Facebook page. Tease it, launch it, whatever." And so it was a Facebook page for about 3 4 months and people were coming on there and joining and interacting and posting and talking about their wins, talking about their struggles.
- [14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=854s) And I had a really good, you know, case study of what people were actually struggling with. It was getting out of their own way, believing in themselves, doing things when they didn't want to emotionally at that time. And so one day I'm driving to work. I was going to a hospital. I was on I75 about Sarasota, Florida. remember this. Exactly.
- [14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=877s) It was at the Clark Road exit and my brain just exploded. It's like, whoa. I started seeing things. I was like, listen, this is not just a Facebook page. I could really help people. I'm going to start a podcast called The Determined Society and I'm going to talk to local people and talk about their success so that way they can help give other people a road map to get out of their own way or to excel in a current industry that they're struggling with. And that's how it started. And I started recording.
- [15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=906s) My first shows were in my car just on my iPhone talking. I love that. And yeah, I eventually moved into my den. And then I had like three iterations of a logo behind me. And then all of a sudden, you know, I don't want to say all of a sudden, but now we're here in a studio. And I'm not talking to local people so much. I'm talking to, you know, names like Jay Leno. You know how it is. You have amazing people on your show. Matthew McConna, Damon, John.
- [15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=930s) you're you're amazing, right? But but that's how it started. It was an accident. Now, deep down, I always wanted to have a show, right? I was listening to the MF CEO project way back in the day with Andy Fcella.
- [15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=949s) I was like, man, if I could have a podcast that pours into people and helps them and I could be unapologetically me, like, dude, I'm all in. I'll double down on that thing. And it kind of just went out of my mind. And then one day, it just all came back and I never looked back. How old were you when you started building your personal brand? I'm wondering because I'm wondering how like everybody else around you treated you when you started trying to have influence online and if there was any doubters or if you had any doubts or felt embarrassed posting online uh especially like you know starting your stuff a little bit older than you know other creators out there. I was 42 years
- [16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=986s) old, successful salesperson, posting things online. Now, the the moment I flipped that camera thing around, I hit that that reverse and I talked into it. It was scary. And what was even scarier is when I posted it because then people are like, "Who do you think you are? What are you doing?" Like, "Dude, you're what what are you trying to be, Tony Robbins?" I'm like, "No, I'm just getting some things out.
- [16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1014s) " And so the way I was treated, you know, at the very beginning it was ignored. You put things out that someone doesn't like. I, you know, talked about mental health in my Facebook group one day and this guy that I used to coach with got like belligerent with me, sending me DMs wanting to meet up with me and and fight it out. I'm like, talk about mental health here. Good lord, man.
- [17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1031s) Like, what's going on with this guy? I used to sit in a dugout with this man and go on road trips with this guy and and just be friends with him and then all of a sudden I post one little thing that's just trying to help people. It was a live video and he just torched me. And so there was a lot of hate. There was a lot of naysayers.
- [17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1050s) There was a lot of people that didn't believe in me. My friends would make fun of me and I don't think they're doing that much now. But you know like look it was I wasn't treated very kindly about it. I was dismissed a lot. Mhm. Yeah. I I can totally relate. I mean, I started my podcast just when I turned 30. And even though I, you know, started my career in radio, I had a blog. I've had multiple shows.
- [17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1074s) I took like a 5-year break. And when I went back to podcasting, I remember my friends were like, "You're too old to start a podcast." Or, "What are you doing? Like, you're ruining your life. You're throwing away your career. You look stupid. You, you know what I mean?" Like, they were really, really negative.
- [18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1092s) And now I have the same friends or some of the same friends who like now want to start a podcast after they see everything that I've done with it, you know? So people always ask you why you're doing it and then they ask you how how to do it, you know. So it's it's everything that you want is is on the other side of cringe when it comes to this uh creator entrepreneurship game.
- [18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1112s) It really is like I remember people saying like why are you starting a show? What have you ever built? What have you ever done? And I believed that story for such a long time. I I was like, "Wait a second. I've overcome a blood clot. I almost lost my life. I went I went and played division one baseball at LSU in the College World Series.
- [18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1129s) I overcame my grandmother's death. I overcome not having a father figure, you know, until I was 9 years old. I've overcome a lot and I've been relatively successful. I'm a welladjusted man. Like, are there any other welladjusted men and women out there that that do have some struggle? Why can't I talk to them?" Right? And so I just I just said, "You know what? People on the sidelines, people in the stands are always going to say something, but I get the opportunity just to show up and fulfill what I believe my purpose is." And that's what
- [19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1161s) I did. So I want to dig into this personal branding stuff because I know that you have a personal branding keynote. You talk a lot about it. So why don't we just start with somebody who wants to start their personal brand today. What are the first couple of things you think that they should do? Really to examine why they're doing it, right? Because, and here's why I say that.
- [19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1184s) Because a lot of people see what's exploded since co, right? Let's just call it let's call spade a spade. They they learned that they saw bar stool blow up during, you know, uh, co. They saw creators blow up and make money online by doing funny videos or just talking into the camera. And then everybody's like, "Well, okay. Well, then I'm going to do that.
- [20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1204s) " But if you're doing it just for that, that that's a that's a long road, right? Like for me is understanding why you are doing it. Are you doing it because you feel you have value to give or do you really feel you want to do this just because of the vanity part of it? And if it's the latter, then you probably shouldn't do it because it took me years to make money.
- [20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1226s) Years. It was a money pit, right? So that's the first thing. And then I go back to who are you helping? Who are you talking to? Who's your audience? And then it's very easy to figure out then once somebody realizes like who was I before you know who how did I operate in my life before? That's who you talk to. That's who you help.
- [20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1248s) Yeah. And so those two things right there will do a lot for you from at the very beginning because it gives you perspective and it gives you a road map because you can literally write everything down that you struggled with or still struggle with at times. Whether it's body image issues, whether it's anxiety, whether it's um rejection, dysphoria, whatever that is, you can literally dive into those things and then talk and you're going to inspire somebody. You're going to have somebody come into your page and says, "Wow,
- [21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1273s) thank you. I really needed that." And you're like, "Wait a second. I'm on to something." And then you just keep doing that. And to your point, you don't need to be like super successful or super rich or, you know, have all these accolades or credentials in order to start speaking online.
- [21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1291s) You could just literally talk about a problem that you had solved yourself. And I love this quote from you. You say, "Your struggle is somebody else's survival guide." Yeah, I I said that one a while back. I mean, it was probably three, four years ago. But listen, that that just goes on to what I'm saying. you know, help the person you used to be.
- [21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1310s) You know, for me, I lack discipline in a lot of areas. And so now, if I could be super disciplined and look the picture of discipline, then I can help somebody else find theirs. And so your struggle, your failures, and and I I think failure is great. I I don't subscribe to failure is bad. I think it's a good thing.
- [22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1330s) It helps you grow obviously, but you know when you when you take your own struggle and turn it into a map for somebody else, that's where the results are. That's why people keep tuning in. That's why new people come in all the time because it's relatable. Yeah. So, uh, you wrote a book a while ago called Unstoppable. And you had this unstoppable process where you talk about five habits.
- [22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1355s) They were mindset, mental toughness, discipline, intention, and transformation. At a high level, can you just break down these habits? And and has has anything changed since you wrote this book in terms of the habits, or are those still the five habits that you believe are a strong foundation for success? Those are the five those are the five habits that I double down every single day.
- [22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1372s) You got to be clear on what you want to do, right? You got to have a road map, which is a strategy. You have to have the strategic activity. You have to have all those things. You have to have mental toughness. you have to have grit. All those different types of things. So for me, that book is way old, right? But at the same time, I live that every day.
- [23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1391s) If I say I'm going to do something, I'm going to do it. And if I don't do it, then you know what that does? It chips away at my confidence. And if it chips at my away at my confidence, my interviews aren't as good. I don't show up well for my wife. I don't show up for my children the way that I know I want to show up. Right. So for me, those those habits are everything.
- [23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1409s) Yeah. So, I'm going to play a game with you called fix the foundation. Okay. Uh oh. So, I'm going to give you a scenario now that we know a little bit about the five habits, everyday scenarios that a lot of us probably can relate to.
- [23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1429s) And then I want you to tell me what habit it is and how we can fix this foundational element. Okay. Okay. Scenario one. I keep setting huge goals at the start of every month, but by week two, I've already fallen off the wagon. What is the habit and how do we fix it? I would. So, it could be a couple things. It could be clarity or it could be strategic activity. All right. So, the clarity is the reason why you're doing it.
- [24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1452s) You better be clear. If you want to get in great shape and you want to be shredded, are you doing it for vanity or you doing because you want to stay alive longer? Right? If you want to be alive longer, who is it for? or is it for your your your spouse, your children? What is it? Right? And then from that point on, you go to the strategic activity.
- [24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1470s) What can I do little by little every single day to build those wins and not go from 0 to 60 right away? Because you're going to fall off. That's why people fall off after the two weeks. They're not clear and they don't have the right strategy. Okay, next one. I get easily discouraged. One small step back and I'm convinced I'm just not good enough. That's mental toughness.
- [24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1493s) That's mental toughness, right? You got to be open to the fact that you're going to fail a little bit. And if you can be open to that and just know that not everything is going to work, you know, and that not good enough complex that comes from somewhere come from childhood, could could come from somebody you know, love and trust so much. It could come from a mom, it could come from a dad. But you have to dive into those things in order to fix that.
- [25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1514s) So being mentally tough and understanding like, hey, look, that's not my story. That's a story someone told me and I chose to subscribe to and believe and make it about me. That might could have been about them. So, I'm going to leave that there.
- [25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1532s) What can I do every single day to fix that? And it's it's really operate out of love for yourself. Everybody talks about you got to love yourself no matter what. I honestly and I get a lot of I don't believe that. I don't I don't love every version of myself. I don't. But I can have love for them, but I don't love the undisiplined Shawn. I don't love the Shawn that decides to sleep in and then eat like crap. Like I don't like that version of me.
- [25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1559s) But I can I can try to rectify that and transform that individual to who I am now out of a place of love, right? It's so funny. I used to this is this is kind of a side note, but my alarm clock used to say something aggressive. Wake up, whatever. You know, now it says I love you, Sean. I love you. And and so when my wife first saw the alarm clock, she goes, "Who wrote that?" I go, "I did.
- [26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1584s) " And she goes, "That doesn't sounds like that doesn't sound like something you would say about yourself." I was like, "Well, see, that's the problem because if I don't get here and see that every morning when I wake up and understand I'm operating and I'm getting up at 4:00 a.m. to go to the gym out of the fact that I love myself, then what am I ever going to become?" Yeah.
- [26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1604s) So it's like telling yourself a different story. But talking about that failure piece, a lot of people are just really stuck on fearing failure, just being so afraid of failure that that they don't just start. How can we reframe failure? Forget everything everybody's told you like literally.
- [27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1626s) So my wife did something very special for me back in 200 probably 17. I was having a very hard month at work and I was failing everywhere. And I was still a top performer, but from from my standards, I was just getting my butt kicked and my teeth kicked in every day. And she sent me this YouTube video and it was Will Smith, Justin Timberlake, and it was just this montage. You know what I'm talking about, those motivational montages.
- [27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1652s) And the first voice says, "Fail early, fail often, fail forward." That was Will Smith's voice. And so for me, I reframed my belief system on failure based on what that video was. I still have it saved. I still listen to it. You know, it's like you have to reframe what failure means.
- [27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1672s) And sometimes you have to go outside because you're not going to have the answer yourself. You got to you got to hear something or see something from people that you know everybody knows and that you respect because they've done so well and they're so successful. And so for me, that's what it was. It's just reframing by listening to that video and watching it over and over and over again until I believed it for myself.
- [28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1691s) I love that. Okay, next one. I've achieved so much on paper, but I still feel empty inside. Like I'm the same person just with better results. Oh, I think that's also I I that one's hard to define, right? That's hard to define the habit because I think that's all the habits mixed together, right? I I I believe that if you focus on the wrong thing, whether it's monetary or vanity, you're always going to feel empty no matter no matter how much you accomplish, right? You could say, "Okay, by this date, I want to make this much money." And then you get
- [28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1725s) there. Then you get there and it's you still feel empty. Retract. It's process. It's process. M the process if you really submit to a standard of what you need to do every single day and make the journey the goal and the win then when you get to that goal like you realize man I I'm empty because I didn't enjoy all this like this is where I live right now like the the journey of building this that's what I geek out on whatever goal I achieve however many li I remember when getting a million listens in a year was
- [29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1763s) like this monumental thing. And then when I got there, I was like, "Oh, shoot. What now?" It's cuz I didn't enjoy all this. Now we do. Now we do that plus 500,000 in a month. But I'm enjoying the struggle. I'm enjoying the process of building this show. So I think it's process. I love that.
- [29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1793s) You've got to enjoy the journey, not just a destination, because then the goalposts just keep moving and moving and moving and moving and you're never happy and it's never enough. So, I totally agree with that. Okay, last one here. I know what I want, but I keep procrastinating and waiting until I feel totally ready. When are you ever really ready? I'm not criticizing the question, but it's something that people need to really ask themselves.
- [30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1817s) Yeah, you're never going to be ready. I was never ready to leave corporate America and give up benefits and you know that big W2, right? So that's clarity in my opinion. Just being clear on what you want out of your life and what you want to give the world and if you feel you have a purpose.
- [30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1834s) So, I feel like my purpose is this and it was put it was given to me by God and I know how upset parents get when their kids don't use their gift. Well, I'm surely not going to squander the gift he gave me, right? That's the ultimate act of disrespect. So, for me, it's just understanding the clarity of like what is your purpose? And if it's your purpose and it's burning you, then you have to move forward.
- [31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1865s) And again, you don't have to go 0 to 60 and quit everything and and and burn the bridges right away because that would be irresponsible because sometimes you got to do what you don't want to do to do what you want to do full-time, right? So being clear on what it is that you are meant for and believing it and operating out of that that belief no matter what everybody else thinks.
- [31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1886s) So for your listeners, you might not ever be ready. You might not ever think it's the perfect time because the perfect time doesn't exist. There's always going to be challenges, but you got to you got to be able to move forward and get the most out of your life. What's your advice for people who feel like they can never get motivated and like they don't know how to motivate themselves? I think motivation is essential to kickstart some things.
- [31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1911s) You know, it it's the Kindle, it's the it's the pilot, right? But what you have to understand is the discipline and understanding what you need to do every day. That that's the real that's the real thing. I'm not motivated. I'm not That's the thing, you know, this mo
- [32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1929s) rning alarm clock goes off at 4:00 a.m. And that's just the time I choose to do it because if I don't do it, then I won't I won't get in the gym later cuz my life is busy. I'm never motivated to wake up at 4:00 a.m. and go to the gym when my body hurts and I'm exhausted, right? I I I'm never motivated to do that. But I said I was going to do it. So, I have to. I have to because you know the easiest word to break is to yourself. No one can see it.
- [32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1955s) No one knows if you're lying to yourself. You can have this whole conversation going on in your mind right now of why it's okay that you didn't get up and and read or send your emails or do whatever it or go for the walk. It doesn't matter if it's walk your dog. I don't care what it is. The moment you say you're going to do something, you don't do it.
- [32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1972s) You chip away at your at your confidence. Right? So that's how I feel. And and again, you don't want to think of it as like, oh my god, I'm a bad person because I didn't wake up today and go to the gym or or do whatever. There's going to be those days, right? But but to sit there and go, you know what? The mere fact that I'm not going to do something because I'm not motivated gives me zero joy. Like, why why are we waiting on the motivation because nothing will ever get done.
- [33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1998s) The only thing I'm really motivated to do every day is hug my children, tell my wife I love her, and record shows. everything else I have to force myself to do. You know, this is an entrepreneurship show. A lot of my listeners are really interested in creator entrepreneurship. I think we have the dream job uh for a lot of people out there.
- [33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2020s) So, what are the different things that you're running in terms of revenue streams and and how are you bringing in revenue with your personal brand as a creator entrepreneur? Yeah, so right now we are obviously with the network. So, we're running ads, you know, we'll we'll start to do some 360 social campaigns. Uh, I help young podcasters in in the new in the business want to launch their show and and I take that as a very, you know, case by case basis because honestly, the last thing I want to do is be on coaching calls all day. I I really don't.
- [34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2047s) Um, but for those people that are truly driven to grow their show, you know, we we do build some good revenue with that because we give the actual value. It's not a cookie cutter thing. I'm the one doing the calls. I'm the one helping them set up their accounts. I'm the one teaching them what an RSS feed is. I'm the one teaching them what a good microphone is.
- [34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2065s) I'm the one teaching what a what a good direction of the show based on their belief system and based on what they want to give the world is. So yeah, and then I do go do speaking engagements. Uh I'm for hire and then I do get asked to go speak to, you know, medical sales teams and and teach them the things that we talked about today so they can perform better.
- [34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2089s) So, uh, for all the entrepreneurs tuning in, I know that you're also a sales expert. What's your best advice saleswise for everybody tuning in, like what are like some pointers that you want to give them or things that they should remember the next time they're going on a sales call? So, this is going to sound silly, all right? Because everybody wants to teach features and benefits, right? They look at my pamphlet. Look at my brochure. This is what this is. This is what it means to you.
- [35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2113s) No one cares about what these no one cares about how much you know until they know how much you care, right? So if you can show up as yourself, right? Because that company hired you for a reason. They liked your personality. But a lot of times they liked your skills, right? And they like your ability to communicate.
- [35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2132s) But a lot of times when people come into organizations, they go to the trainings and they hear everything that the train, you know, the the lead trainers are talking about and they feel like they have to have that same verbiage that that same energy and they change everything about them. They fall flat on their face cuz that's was happening to me.
- [35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2150s) So show up as you and show them how much you care. Find the problem. People think sales is selling something. It's solving a problem. And if you can solve a problem for somebody, whether it's payroll, whether it's medical, whether it's podcasting, whether it's a roof, a roofing company, it doesn't matter.
- [36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2175s) If there's a pain point and you can respectfully solve it and they like you, they're going to buy. Great. So, I also know Jade, uh, do you wake up, how how early do you wake up? Are you an early riser? 4:00 a.m. 4:00 a.m. Why do you wake up at 4:00 a.m.? Because the day gets going, right, and things happen, stress happens, and if I don't do the one thing that I know makes me a better person and operate on camera and on the microphone better, which is being in good physical condition and eating well, if I don't do that first thing in the mo
- [36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2204s) rning at 4:00 a.m., I'll say, "I'll do it later." And I won't. M and that happens again the next day and the next day and the next day and then 25 lbs later and and 6 months later I'm you know this version of myself that I don't like. So for me that's why I get up at 4:00 a.m. and go.
- [37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2228s) So I don't know about you but for me the most important thing for me to make sure that I have good interviews is making sure I get good sleep. That is definitely the most important thing. And so I make sure that I never do anything crazy the night before an interview and that I'm like in routine and anytime I've ever tried like and I end up not having good sleep, it's like something that I totally regret.
- [37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2253s) So what are some of the things that you do to ensure that you're at like peak performance when it comes to your interviews? I eat whole foods. All right. I get good sleep, decent sleep, six, seven hours a night and and I work out and then all the decisions leading up to the actual interviews, I'm preparing obviously, right, for my guest. I have a good idea of what they do and my show is very open format. We just have great conversation and it's very natural.
- [37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2277s) So for me, as long as I'm sharp, I don't drink alcohol very often. I mean, probably twice a year. And it's not because I'm this guy that doesn't believe in alcohol. just doesn't work for me. I don't metabolize it well.
- [38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2294s) So, I'll wake up, if I have two beers, I'll wake up groggy the next day and I'm not having this great conversation like I'm having with you. So, I try to keep my mind as clear as possible, right? I do have a great team. So, when I record something, my team does the clips, they post it for me, I have people do my engagement. So, I'm not tied to my screen. I'm not tied to a bunch of other things that are filling my mind with clutter.
- [38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2314s) And I feel energized. So that's just that's just kind of how I operate. At YAP, we have a super unique company culture. We're all about obsessive excellence and even call ourselves scrappy hustlers. My team is growing every day.
- [38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2331s) And luckily, when it comes to hiring, I no longer feel overwhelmed by the search for the perfect candidate because when it comes to hiring, Indeed is all you need. Stop struggling to get your post notice on job sites. Indeed sponsored jobs helps you stand out and hire fast by boosting your post to the top relevant candidates.

In fact, in the minute I've been talking to you, 23 hires were made on Indeed, according to Indeed data worldwide. Plus, there's no subscriptions or long-term contracts with Indeed.

- [39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2385s) Hiring Indeed is all you need. Hello young and profits. I know so many people out there and their workday wondering why certain tasks take forever and why they procrastinate or why they don't feel confident in their work. And that frustration can leave you feeling drained, unfulfilled, and burned out.
- [40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2402s) But here's the thing, that's not a character flaw. It's your natural wiring. And I learned that only after taking the working genius assessment created by Patrick Lencion, a legendary business influencer, entrepreneur, author. This assessment helps you identify the type of work you're actually built for and the work that you're not. And there's zero shame in that.
- [40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2422s) Once I took that assessment, I realized that my two strongest working geniuses are galvanizing and invention. And I'm meant to lead to rally people, inspire them, and invent. And those are the two core things that I should spend most of my time on. And my two frustrations are enablement and wonder. And so I don't like to wonder and vision too far off in the future. I like to just tackle what's ahead of me.
- [40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2445s) And so I released guilt and the frustrations that I had. and I instead elevated others like Kate and Jason in my organization to help me with the wonder and enablement piece. So, Working Genius helps you fill those gaps in your organization.
- [41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2464s) It takes about 10 minutes of your time and you get an assessment report that tells you your six working geniuses and whether it's a working genius, a competency, or a frustration. Now, this is not a personality test. This actually evaluates the way that you work. If you're an entrepreneur, a CEO, or somebody who wants to operate at your highest level, this assessment helps you double down on what you're naturally good at.
- [41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2481s) Take the Working Genius Assessment and get 20% off with code profiting at workinggenius.com. Again, that's workinggenius.com. Stop guessing. Start working in your genius. Um, speaking of some of these like mental patterns, you've said in the past thoughts are random, but thinking is not.
- [41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2505s) So, how can we make sure that we control our our mental patterns? And uh that's also about showing up as your best self because if I'm here and I'm thinking about, you know, some, you know, client or or something and and not present, it's going to mess up the interview. No. Sure.
- [42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2523s) So, I think that, you know, random thoughts, right? And I think the context around that quote was, you know, the you mentioned earlier like people that think I'm not good enough or I'm ugly or that person hates me. That's a random thought. Everybody's going to have these random negative thoughts. But true thinking is how you respond afterwards. Is it actually true? And if you feel it is true, okay, what's the evidence? What are the examples of why I'm not good enough? Explain that.
- [42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2546s) Right? And then you have this dialogue with yourself. And after a while, you go, "Wait a second. I've done this. I've done that. I've done this. I've done the other thing. I am good enough." Right? And so you just have to work yourself through those moments. Like random thought, it's okay.
- [42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2564s) You know, negative thinking is believing that that random thought and letting it perpetuate the rest of your day in your life. There's a big difference there. There's a big gap. Okay. So, as we close out this interview, I want to talk to you about networking. So, you just mentioned earlier that you had Jay Leno on the show, which is huge, and you've got some really big names that have come on your show.
- [43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2584s) So, what what are you doing these days to have a really high value network? What are some of the things that you do? I have secret weapons. What's that? No, I have a great publicist, Val Zucker. Oh, nice. She's amazing. She's, you know, and again, it's something that, you know, like a lot of us, See, that's the authenticity part of it, right? A lot of people say, "Well, I don't just I just I just send DMs. I just show up." And like, no, no, no, no, no.
- [43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2609s) I built a whole team, right? I built a whole team to support me, to help me grow my brand, improve my image, and it's everybody in the background doing amazing work, even down to my production team that that creates amazing visuals and clips and gets everything out on time, spends times on my partner does the show notes and he does the graphics for the the YouTube thumbnail and the and the, you know, the the cover.
- [43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2633s) Like all these things are working and these people are helping me grow this thing. So everything put together, but but really it was about, you know, me trusting somebody and knowing that I needed publicity, knowing that I needed news media, knowing that I needed all these things. And there was a time where I was just wearing a hat on my show and I was wondering why I wasn't going anywhere, right? And there was no brand.
- [44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2652s) It was a cool podcast. It was neat. It was it was a hobby. But the moment that I changed my image and changed how I operated in my discipline day-to-day, investors came, partners came and it all started to work together and then it gave me the opportunity to go, okay, now now I can go find a great publicist.
- [44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2677s) So you mentioned earlier how you know you started with really low-level equipment. I know Jenna Kutcher, I have a podcast network. I don't know if you know that. So Jenna Kutcher is in my podcast network. She started recording in her car with no microphone. I two years into podcasting interviewed Matthew McConna in my mother's basement. And so like you know everybody thinks like this is some overnight success that you need to have all this money to pump into equipment but you have a really great like origin story where you weren't even like you know entrepreneur or anything when you started. You quit corporate you were in your 40s. you got
- [45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2710s) started and just built brick by brick to become where you are today. So just walk us through like what were some of the big milestones in terms of like how you started and then like you know for me it's like I had a volunteer team of 20 people and like I just kept like leveling up.
- [45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2729s) What was your journey like? Yeah. So and thank you for that. Yeah. The origin story of the determined society also started like Jenna Kutchers. It was in my car right I had an iPhone. I was talking into it. some of the milestones. Well, the first milestone was recording that show. And it went something like this. Hi, this is Sean the Determined Society.
- [45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2745s) I don't know if anybody's going to listen. I hope you do. And if you do, I hope you like it. I just went through and I just had no plan. And then the next day, I was, you know, combing through and Apple podcast and I noticed that my show was on Apple. I was like, "Wow, that that for me was a big moment, right? M it it wasn't, you know, burning the world down, but I'm like, "Oh my gosh, how did I how do I have an Apple podcast?" I didn't even know how it worked.
- [46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2771s) Had no idea. So, that was a big milestone for me. And then when I learned that I could upload video to Ankor, I started doing Zoom interviews, right? And they were terrible. Like, I couldn't even figure out how to like, why would I ever hit record before someone came in? Why would I ever do it? I did and so like it was clunky and but but you know and then I had Andy Fcell's co-host uh DJ on then I had Larry Hagner on from the data edge podcast and then it started giving me this this belief system that I could get cool people on and have good interviews but I mean
- [46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2809s) another small milestone was when I print this is going to this is you're going to laugh. I printed off the original logo of the determined society which was a word cluster for crying out loud. Paula, a word cluster so bad. And I put it in a frame from CVS or Walgreens. I can't remember which one.
- [47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2831s) And then I got the 3M the 3M tape, the double-sided tape, and I just like official. This is dope. Look at this thing, man. And I look back at it and I just want to throw up. But that was a milestone for me, right? So there's many milestones that I look back on that mortified me then, but now I'm very proud of because the audience has been able to see my my growth, my stages, right? So starting off like having everything, it's not necessarily a good thing. I think you need to want a little bit. I think you need to get your butt
- [47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2861s) kicked a little bit because then you can really appreciate this industry as you know that is very hard. Well, talk to us about the team you built over this journey. Like what was the first thing you outsourced? What was the first thing you invested in? Well, the first thing I outsourced was editing, right? I would pay somebody like a hundred, you know, bucks an episode and then I was like, "Wow, this is expensive." Right? And my wife's like, "Hey, wait a second here. You're spending 400, 500 bucks on editing."
- [48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2887s) This was at the very beginning. I outsourced it. And then, you know, before it was monetizing, you know, I was taking the family income and doing that. I'm like, "Wait a second. I need to learn how to edit myself so I can get my show out and not take away from my kids, right? So, because I didn't want I didn't want to do that.
- [48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2906s) I didn't want to be selfish with it. That was the first thing I outsourced. And then I started outsourcing, you know, things like, you know, graphic design, things like that and uh distribution and then I went back to editing and uh and then finally production, right? in production was, you know, my my first goaround wasn't the greatest, but my team now, they kill it for me. They move mountains for me.
- [48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2936s) So, uh, and then it was PR and then, you know, some social media engage, not engagement, but more social media um, management, right? Like I I that's something I I want to talk to you about actually, but it's it's something that I don't want to do, right? And so those are all little things that I've outsourced and pretty much everything, you know, I would say mostly other than the back-end conversations with Valerie, my partners, that was another big thing.
- [49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2969s) Reena and Brad Miller, Pat Sickens, Roman Gaye, my wife's involved, you know, without my partners, like I would be a hot mess. I truly would, you know. So instead of being prideful of like I own this 100%. Yeah. 100% of zero is still zero. Yeah.
- [49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2992s) It's true. You know. Yeah. So those are all the things that we've outsourced, right? And to the point now where you know how it works. I don't even I don't even hunt for my own campaigns anymore, right? Like we have people doing that and and it's great because then I can focus on this. Yeah.
- [50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3012s) But to your point, it's important like I feel that you are probably a better podcaster because you were hands-on in the beginning. You did edit your own stuff in the beginning and uh so you probably have a lot more empathy with your team and like understand what they're doing and also can help direct them better because you were hands-on from the start. So I think there's an advantage with that. It was just it's tactical.
- [50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3029s) It's a tactical business, right? it I think it doing all those things to your point at the very beginning made me better right it made it it helped me grow exponentially because if you look at it like you know four years in and we're doing the numbers that we're doing with no marketing like I still haven't pushed the button on marketing I it's something that we would I know right I know she's like dang it she see Danny See Danny's watching he's like you're you're you're in a sales pitch right now and I and I and I'm here for
- [51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3060s) it. I love it because the bottom line is without a real integrated marketing plan or any type of get the word out, right? It's hard to grow. So, I've been blessed. I'm I'm fortunate. Sean, I end my interview with two questions that I ask all of my guests. The first one is one what is one piece of actionable advice our young and profiters can take today to be more profitable tomorrow? I would say know the thing that you want to do and why, right? Because I I think it's very basic. It's so basic and it just like
- [51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3095s) the people are probably listening like is he really just saying that? But they're saying it and it triggers them because they they're not doing it right. Why do you really want to do the social media business? Why do you want to do podcasting? Why do you want to go sell cars? You have to have some type of passion around why you're doing it because it's going to be hard. It's you're gonna get you're gonna get your your teeth kicked in a little bit.
- [52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3120s) I said it that a few times today, but it's true. You're not going to always be successful in every single moment. So, you have to understand that this is going to be difficult and is the struggle worth it for me? And if you don't want to go through that struggle, you probably shouldn't be going do that thing.
- [52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3138s) So, find what you want to do and know the reason why you want to do it and be clear on it. and then make a plan. Don't listen to anybody. Don't listen to anybody that hasn't done what you're trying to do or been very successful at it. I'm sorry. It's just It's just the way it is. It's true. People could love you so much and give you terrible advice speaking from their own insecurities.
- [52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3159s) Absolutely. So, the last question is, what is your secret to profiting in life? And this can go beyond business and financial. just like what do you feel like is the recipe for success in life? The recipe or what does it look like? So the I mean the recipe is just staying in my process, you know, just what I wrote in the book. If I can stick to that, then I know I know I'm in a good spot.
- [53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3184s) You you have to be a lifelong learner as well. By no means do I think I have it figured out. Trust me, there's many shows of mine that I listen back to. I'm like, "Dude, you could have done better there." Like there was a question you could have gone deeper with. you can be better, Sean. So, I'm always open for feedback and I think people should always be open for feedback, especially successful people because there's always somebody more successful than you. But for me, when I look at the total enrichment of life, right? I look at am
- [53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3211s) I a success? Does my wife and my children feel safe? Tell me their feelings. That's it. That has to be an astounding yes. And it's not always a yes, right? Because we're human beings. We mess up a little bit at times. We don't have the right reactions to things.
- [53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3231s) But as long as I handle my process, handle the things that I need to, and that my family feels safe and expressing to me, that is that is everything to me. Why is it so important that that that your family feels like they can express to you and your family feels safe? Like, why is that so important to you? It's a great question. Cuz I didn't have it. I didn't have it. You know, I had I had parents that love me, my mom. I have a great relationship with my mom.
- [54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3253s) But you know, hey, you know, some people have, you know, more emotional capabilities to be there for people. And, you know, I I grew up, like I said, you know, the first eight, nine years without a father figure, right? So, for me, it was just there was times where I wasn't feeling seen and heard and understood.
- [54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3270s) And so, I just I always told myself like, I'm going to be the exact opposite. And I'm not slamming my mom. I'm not. I love that woman. Love you, mom. Like, it's not that. It's just the reality of it. She had her own childhood that she's still healing from, right? She never got through it because the family sheltered her from the reality and they didn't allow her to grow, right? They they masked it.
- [54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3296s) And so, how could she ever, you know, have the tools to be there for me in those certain moments that I needed cuz I didn't even know what I needed. So, that that's the reason why I just didn't have that. H any last words for the 60 to 80,000 young entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs that are going to listen to this episode? Enjoy the ride.
- [55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3321s) Like literally, literally enjoy the ride because there's not too many people that are going to do what you are trying to do. See all these entrepreneurs, the 80,000 of them listening right now, they think their reality is everybody else's reality. The reality truly is is what you're doing is scary. What you're doing is hard. And there's not a whole lot of people that are that are sitting there banking on your success.
- [55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3341s) They're waiting for the phone call for you to fail. So don't ever give them the opportunity to receive that phone call. Dig in hard. Understand why you're doing it and never come off of it. Because at the end of the day, my biggest fear and I and I would hope that most people fear this is being on my deathbed wishing I would have done more, wishing I would have chased my dream, wishing I would have enacted a little bit more strategy.
- [56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3365s) You're not going to be worried like, well, I had this car, had this amazing house. You're going be like, did I do everything? Did I do everything that I wanted to? And so, as long as you stay true to that and keep that at the forefront of your mind every day, how the hell are you going to lose? H I love that, Sean. Uh this was such a great conversation.
- [56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3384s) Where can everybody learn more about you and everything that you do? Well, thank you for that. I had a blast. Uh you can go to the determinedocciety.com, right? That's the website. Um we're on Spotify at the determined society. Same with Apple and uh Instagram is the Sean French. And you know, I'm pretty easy to pretty easy to get to know. I'm I'm pretty approachable.
- [56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3402s) Awesome. Well, thank you so much for joining us on Young and Profiting Podcast. Thanks for having me. All right, Yap gang. I hope you got a lot out of my conversation with Shawn French. He is yet another example of somebody who turned deep adversity into unstoppable drive.
- [57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3421s) Shawn went from breaking down his truck paralyzed by fear and self-doubt to becoming a top 1% salesperson, a powerful speaker, and a creator who built the determined society from the ground up. What I love about Shawn's story is how simple yet profound his turnaround really was. He didn't find success through luck or magic.
- [57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3440s) He found it through clarity, preparation, and discipline. When he realized he was failing because he wasn't prepared, he didn't make excuses. He started planning his days down to the zip code, logging every single action and executing with intention. That structure became the blueprint for his unstoppable process and the foundation for everything he's built since.
- [57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3460s) Shawn also reminded us that authenticity is everything. People don't buy products, they buy people. Whether you're in sales, leadership, or building a personal brand, showing up as your true self with empathy and consistency is what earns trust and drives connection.
- [57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3479s) The moment Sean stopped trying to sound like everyone else and just showed up as himself, his career exploded. And one of my favorite takeaways was his idea that discipline beats motivation every time. Motivation fades. But keeping your promises to yourself builds confidence and that confidence compounds into success. Every rep you do at 4 a.m.
- [58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3498s) , every time you follow through when nobody else is watching, you're proving to yourself that you can be trusted. So, if you're waiting for that perfect moment to start that project, pivot your career, or share your story, remember Shaun's words. You'll never feel ready. Move anyway. The process itself is where the growth and motivation happens. Yap fam.
- [58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3517s) If you listen, learned, and profited from this episode with Shawn, share it with a friend who's ready to become unstoppable, too. And if you haven't already, I'd really appreciate if you took a quick second to drop us a five-star review on Apple Podcast, Spotify, or Castbox, wherever you tune in. I'd love to read your reviews. They're really important for social proof.

- [00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=8s) solve it and they like you, they're going to buy. Sean French is a high performance coach, keynote speaker, and host of the top rated podcast, The Determined Society. I remember people saying like, "Why are you starting a show? What have you ever built? What have you ever done?" I wasn't treated very kindly about it.
- [00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=26s) I was dismissed a lot. What was the mental shift that you had to go through to double triple your sales and become a top 1% salesperson? What story did I want to tell my son? Like there's no way am I ever going to tell my children that I quit doing something because it was hard. You say people buy people, not products.
- [00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=48s) Talk to us why authenticity in sales really matters. I think people need to like you in sales. It's really big. When people make emotional buys, they buy the person that they're working with because they feel comfortable. they like them or they can trust them.
- [01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=64s) What are the different things that you're running in terms of revenue streams and and how are you bringing in revenue with your personal brand as a creator entrepreneur? Yeah. So, right now we are obviously What's up young and profiters? Have you ever been so terrified of failure that you physically couldn't move? That's where Sean French found himself sitting in his truck on a rainy day unable to walk through another door.
- [01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=84s) The anxiety was so crushing, he was ready to quit sales and return to teaching. But then his boss asked him a question that changed everything. What are you going to tell your son about why you quit? Today, Sean French is a high performance coach, keynote speaker, and host of the top rated podcast, The Determined Society.
- [01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=102s) In this episode, he shares how he went from that breakdown to becoming a top 1% salesperson. how he then went on to build a thriving personal brand in his 40s and why your struggle is truly somebody else's survival guide. Together, we'll talk about pushing past fear, leading with authenticity, and turning pain into purpose. Yeah, fam. I know you're going to love this one.
- [02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=121s) So, sit back and enjoy this conversation. Sean, welcome to Young and Profiting Podcast. So excited to be here. Good to see you. Yeah, I'm excited. I'm excited to speak with you today, get all of your wisdom. And when I was doing research about you this morning, I found out that you had a breaking point in your truck one day and that was really like the pivotal moment in your life where you just transformed your life and went in a new direction. So talk to us about what happened that day in the truck, what was going through
- [02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=154s) your mind and how it led to the unstoppable process. Oh, thank you for that. So I think you're referring to the day where I broke down in tears. Mhm. Yeah. So, I had left teaching and went into, you know, payroll sales and, you know, I had my first child and I wanted to be able to provide a better life for him, right? More money, more more opportunities to do things and provide experiences. And man, the first 90 days, it was just so bad. I was so terrible at it.
- [03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=185s) It was like walking into from door to door that I just sometimes I was just stuck. I couldn't get a word out and I was just embarrassed. And I started getting this type of anxiety to where I would pull up to an office or a place of business and I literally could not get out of the vehicle. I was so terrified of something that wasn't going to even kill me.
- [03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=206s) But how I was defining it, it was so big and large. And so I found myself driving around my territory and then I parked at a grocery store and it was pouring down rain in Marco Island, Florida and I literally broke down.
- [03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=228s) I was like, I can't do this anymore and I just need to quit this and I need to go back to doing what I was really good at, which which was coaching baseball. And the only way to coach baseball was to teach school, right? So, it was like a vehicle to get to do what I wanted to do. And so, I went into my good friend Dan Tupperella who was my who was my boss at the time. It's funny enough, I just hired him to work for us.
- [04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=246s) So, he starts Monday, but funny how the Dave will stern. Yeah, it's great, isn't it? Uh, and and I just said to him, "Hey, this isn't for me. You know, I I'm going to go back to do what I what I know best. Like, I just can't do this anymore. I'm terrible. I'm sorry.
- [04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=263s) " And he looked at me and he said, "You know what? I told you I was going to give you a year and you're going to do the same thing for me." I was like, "Buddy, like I I can't do this. I can't live a year like this." He's like, "Well, you have a decision to make, man, because one day your son's going to ask you, "Why did you stop working at paychecks? What are you going to do? Tell him quit?" I was like, "Wait a second. You're on to something here.
- [04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=278s) " So that evening I decided to really get introspective and understand why I wasn't doing well. And and the overarching theme was I wasn't prepared enough. I didn't have a plan. I didn't have a strategy. I was just getting in my truck and just boopping around the community trying to get business.
- [04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=298s) And so I just literally started taking notes every single day and I made commitments of what zip codes I was going to be in every single day. And I predetermined where I was going to stop. think thought of some things that I was going to bring up and talk about. Even it was just going to say, "Hey, I'm Sean French. I'm your rep. I just wanted to say hello. I don't know if there's a need here, but I would love to explore it if there is.
- [05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=317s) " And from that day on, I caught fire. I just exploded that month and the month after and the month after and the month after. And it was five years of that. Literally five years. Then I went into the medical industry and did the same thing until I was tired of it until where, you know, this came up.
- [05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=336s) the podcast came up and I'm like, I've got to go all in on this and I took the principles that I use here from my early days at Paycheck. So, that that day literally built me in that career and then in my next venture into medical and it's what I apply here every single day.
- [05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=357s) H I love how you explained the being tactical like a lot of sales um is sort of bottoms up strategy like the more emails that you send the more opportunities that you get the more likely that things will close. But what was going on mentally for you at that time? Like what was the mental shift that you had to go through to you know double triple your sales and become a top 1% salesperson? What story did I want to tell my son? you know what did I what what how did I want to lead? So for me it was the he dangled the carrot because he knew how much I love being a father. He knew how
- [06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=391s) much I love my son. He was I think about a year at the time. He's like are what are you going to tell your kid or your future kids you know that you quit something? And so for me that that mindset shift for me it was it was immediate.
- [06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=409s) It's like there's no way on God's green earth am I ever going to tell my children that I quit doing something because it was hard. Yeah. So, you have a quote that you say, "People buy people, not products." Talk to us why authenticity in sales really matters. I think people need to like you, right? They got to understand that they can be comfortable around you, that you're not going to judge them for certain things that they say.
- [07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=428s) You know, in sales, it's it's it's really big because let's face it, paychecks may not have been the best product out there all the time. It may not have been the cheapest, but when people make emotional buys, they buy the person that they're working with because they feel comfortable, they like them, or they can trust them.
- [07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=447s) And so, I've taken those same principles into the podcasting career is what I do now 100% of the time. And it's just really what it is. People people listen to the show because they either like me or they stumbled into me and they stay or leave for either not liking me or really liking the authenticity piece of it, which is the latter part of your question. In a world where everybody's talking about being authentic, I pride myself on actually being authentic.
- [07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=473s) And I'm going to show up how I show up and I'm going to say what I feel, but I'm also going to do it with empathy. And I think that is the main difference is like how can you show up like this every day? And then I just realized all this like I'm just going to be me. I'm not going to try to be somebody else. I'm not going to try to be you. I'm going to be how I feel I am.
- [08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=492s) And of course there's different growth patterns and stages of every individual. But for me it's just about living your truth. And I think that shines through with everything that I do. When you say living for me, how do you define what that is? like do you have core values that you stick by? Um you know how do you make sure that you always act how you want to act and represent yourself? So first and foremost family you know family is at the forefront of my mind. My wife and my three children and I always want to represent them well. And
- [08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=523s) so for me that is my initial temperature gauge. Am I representing my wife and my children well right now? And if I am okay I'm gonna keep doing that. But but I that's really my only gauge. And then also, I mean, it's it's pretty simple, but I like to keep things simple because if I start getting complicated with things, I can get lost.
- [09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=548s) My ADHD kicks in and I'm gone, right? So, I really focus on what can I control? I can control how I show up. I control my attitude and I control my effort and that's it. What's up, young and profits? I remember when I first started YAP, I used to dread missing important calls.

You had this awesome sales career and then you pivoted into creating your personal brand with this podcast, with writing a book.
- [11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=703s) Why did you make that change? What made you want to become a creator, entrepreneur, and put your face out there? I didn't. I I did I like like seriously I did not want to. So, it was about 2020, I think 2021. I think it was about 2020. And my wife and I got approached by a good friend of mine to go to this direct sales company called Melleuca.
- [12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=729s) And they said, "Well, if you're going to sell this stuff, you'd be really good at it, but you need to have a personal brand." And I go, "Well, I'm not an inventor. I don't have a product. I don't What are you talking about?" I didn't even know what it was, right? She's like, "Well, no, like what do people say about you? What's your brand?" I go, "I don't know. I have no idea." So, I was a hard case study for her. And she goes, "Well, look, this is what we're going to do.
- [12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=748s) We're going to post a p you post a picture of yourself on your stories and then make a question box, right? It says, "What's the first word you think of when you see me?" And that scared me. First of all, I only had like 700 followers at the time. I didn't know what a question box was. That was a heavy lift for me and it was scary.
- [12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=767s) And so my friends had some choice funny words, right? Like you have a stupid hat on or some other derogatory comments, but the the main theme was leader, coach, determined, determined, determination. So there's this massive response of some derivative of the word determined. And so I went back to her with that information and she said, "Okay, great. Now make a Facebook group.
- [13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=793s) " I called, "What? Like just call determined? Like who's going to want to go to that?" She goes, "No, like you find ways to create the name of the Facebook group based on your personal brand." I'm like, "So you're telling me my brand is determined?" And she goes, "Yes, that's what people say about you. That's what your brand is.
- [13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=812s) How people view you is who you are to an extent, right?" So I said, "Okay, I don't get it. I I don't get it. I don't understand it." She got frustrated and said, "Sean, what in the world do you want out of life?" I go, "Honestly, you know what? I want to wake up in a society where they're deter where people wake up determined to chase their dreams no matter how they feel emotionally at that time." She goes, "Determined society." I go, "I don't like it.
- [13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=835s) " She go, I said, "It's missing something." I said, "It's missing the word 'the'. So, let's go the determined society." She goes, "Great. Make your Facebook page. Tease it, launch it, whatever." And so it was a Facebook page for about 3 4 months and people were coming on there and joining and interacting and posting and talking about their wins, talking about their struggles.
- [14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=854s) And I had a really good, you know, case study of what people were actually struggling with. It was getting out of their own way, believing in themselves, doing things when they didn't want to emotionally at that time. And so one day I'm driving to work. I was going to a hospital. I was on I75 about Sarasota, Florida. remember this. Exactly.
- [14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=877s) It was at the Clark Road exit and my brain just exploded. It's like, whoa. I started seeing things. I was like, listen, this is not just a Facebook page. I could really help people. I'm going to start a podcast called The Determined Society and I'm going to talk to local people and talk about their success so that way they can help give other people a road map to get out of their own way or to excel in a current industry that they're struggling with. And that's how it started. And I started recording.
- [15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=906s) My first shows were in my car just on my iPhone talking. I love that. And yeah, I eventually moved into my den. And then I had like three iterations of a logo behind me. And then all of a sudden, you know, I don't want to say all of a sudden, but now we're here in a studio. And I'm not talking to local people so much. I'm talking to, you know, names like Jay Leno. You know how it is. You have amazing people on your show. Matthew McConna, Damon, John.
- [15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=930s) you're you're amazing, right? But but that's how it started. It was an accident. Now, deep down, I always wanted to have a show, right? I was listening to the MF CEO project way back in the day with Andy Fcella.
- [15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=949s) I was like, man, if I could have a podcast that pours into people and helps them and I could be unapologetically me, like, dude, I'm all in. I'll double down on that thing. And it kind of just went out of my mind. And then one day, it just all came back and I never looked back. How old were you when you started building your personal brand? I'm wondering because I'm wondering how like everybody else around you treated you when you started trying to have influence online and if there was any doubters or if you had any doubts or felt embarrassed posting online uh especially like you know starting your stuff a little bit older than you know other creators out there. I was 42 years
- [16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=986s) old, successful salesperson, posting things online. Now, the the moment I flipped that camera thing around, I hit that that reverse and I talked into it. It was scary. And what was even scarier is when I posted it because then people are like, "Who do you think you are? What are you doing?" Like, "Dude, you're what what are you trying to be, Tony Robbins?" I'm like, "No, I'm just getting some things out.
- [16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1014s) " And so the way I was treated, you know, at the very beginning it was ignored. You put things out that someone doesn't like. I, you know, talked about mental health in my Facebook group one day and this guy that I used to coach with got like belligerent with me, sending me DMs wanting to meet up with me and and fight it out. I'm like, talk about mental health here. Good lord, man.
- [17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1031s) Like, what's going on with this guy? I used to sit in a dugout with this man and go on road trips with this guy and and just be friends with him and then all of a sudden I post one little thing that's just trying to help people. It was a live video and he just torched me. And so there was a lot of hate. There was a lot of naysayers.
- [17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1050s) There was a lot of people that didn't believe in me. My friends would make fun of me and I don't think they're doing that much now. But you know like look it was I wasn't treated very kindly about it. I was dismissed a lot. Mhm. Yeah. I I can totally relate. I mean, I started my podcast just when I turned 30. And even though I, you know, started my career in radio, I had a blog. I've had multiple shows.
- [17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1074s) I took like a 5-year break. And when I went back to podcasting, I remember my friends were like, "You're too old to start a podcast." Or, "What are you doing? Like, you're ruining your life. You're throwing away your career. You look stupid. You, you know what I mean?" Like, they were really, really negative.
- [18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1092s) And now I have the same friends or some of the same friends who like now want to start a podcast after they see everything that I've done with it, you know? So people always ask you why you're doing it and then they ask you how how to do it, you know. So it's it's everything that you want is is on the other side of cringe when it comes to this uh creator entrepreneurship game.
- [18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1112s) It really is like I remember people saying like why are you starting a show? What have you ever built? What have you ever done? And I believed that story for such a long time. I I was like, "Wait a second. I've overcome a blood clot. I almost lost my life. I went I went and played division one baseball at LSU in the College World Series.
- [18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1129s) I overcame my grandmother's death. I overcome not having a father figure, you know, until I was 9 years old. I've overcome a lot and I've been relatively successful. I'm a welladjusted man. Like, are there any other welladjusted men and women out there that that do have some struggle? Why can't I talk to them?" Right? And so I just I just said, "You know what? People on the sidelines, people in the stands are always going to say something, but I get the opportunity just to show up and fulfill what I believe my purpose is." And that's what
- [19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1161s) I did. So I want to dig into this personal branding stuff because I know that you have a personal branding keynote. You talk a lot about it. So why don't we just start with somebody who wants to start their personal brand today. What are the first couple of things you think that they should do? Really to examine why they're doing it, right? Because, and here's why I say that.
- [19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1184s) Because a lot of people see what's exploded since co, right? Let's just call it let's call spade a spade. They they learned that they saw bar stool blow up during, you know, uh, co. They saw creators blow up and make money online by doing funny videos or just talking into the camera. And then everybody's like, "Well, okay. Well, then I'm going to do that.
- [20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1204s) " But if you're doing it just for that, that that's a that's a long road, right? Like for me is understanding why you are doing it. Are you doing it because you feel you have value to give or do you really feel you want to do this just because of the vanity part of it? And if it's the latter, then you probably shouldn't do it because it took me years to make money.
- [20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1226s) Years. It was a money pit, right? So that's the first thing. And then I go back to who are you helping? Who are you talking to? Who's your audience? And then it's very easy to figure out then once somebody realizes like who was I before you know who how did I operate in my life before? That's who you talk to. That's who you help.
- [20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1248s) Yeah. And so those two things right there will do a lot for you from at the very beginning because it gives you perspective and it gives you a road map because you can literally write everything down that you struggled with or still struggle with at times. Whether it's body image issues, whether it's anxiety, whether it's um rejection, dysphoria, whatever that is, you can literally dive into those things and then talk and you're going to inspire somebody. You're going to have somebody come into your page and says, "Wow,
- [21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1273s) thank you. I really needed that." And you're like, "Wait a second. I'm on to something." And then you just keep doing that. And to your point, you don't need to be like super successful or super rich or, you know, have all these accolades or credentials in order to start speaking online.
- [21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1291s) You could just literally talk about a problem that you had solved yourself. And I love this quote from you. You say, "Your struggle is somebody else's survival guide." Yeah, I I said that one a while back. I mean, it was probably three, four years ago. But listen, that that just goes on to what I'm saying. you know, help the person you used to be.
- [21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1310s) You know, for me, I lack discipline in a lot of areas. And so now, if I could be super disciplined and look the picture of discipline, then I can help somebody else find theirs. And so your struggle, your failures, and and I I think failure is great. I I don't subscribe to failure is bad. I think it's a good thing.
- [22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1330s) It helps you grow obviously, but you know when you when you take your own struggle and turn it into a map for somebody else, that's where the results are. That's why people keep tuning in. That's why new people come in all the time because it's relatable. Yeah. So, uh, you wrote a book a while ago called Unstoppable. And you had this unstoppable process where you talk about five habits.
- [22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1355s) They were mindset, mental toughness, discipline, intention, and transformation. At a high level, can you just break down these habits? And and has has anything changed since you wrote this book in terms of the habits, or are those still the five habits that you believe are a strong foundation for success? Those are the five those are the five habits that I double down every single day.
- [22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1372s) You got to be clear on what you want to do, right? You got to have a road map, which is a strategy. You have to have the strategic activity. You have to have all those things. You have to have mental toughness. you have to have grit. All those different types of things. So for me, that book is way old, right? But at the same time, I live that every day.
- [23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1391s) If I say I'm going to do something, I'm going to do it. And if I don't do it, then you know what that does? It chips away at my confidence. And if it chips at my away at my confidence, my interviews aren't as good. I don't show up well for my wife. I don't show up for my children the way that I know I want to show up. Right. So for me, those those habits are everything.
- [23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1409s) Yeah. So, I'm going to play a game with you called fix the foundation. Okay. Uh oh. So, I'm going to give you a scenario now that we know a little bit about the five habits, everyday scenarios that a lot of us probably can relate to.
- [23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1429s) And then I want you to tell me what habit it is and how we can fix this foundational element. Okay. Okay. Scenario one. I keep setting huge goals at the start of every month, but by week two, I've already fallen off the wagon. What is the habit and how do we fix it? I would. So, it could be a couple things. It could be clarity or it could be strategic activity. All right. So, the clarity is the reason why you're doing it.
- [24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1452s) You better be clear. If you want to get in great shape and you want to be shredded, are you doing it for vanity or you doing because you want to stay alive longer? Right? If you want to be alive longer, who is it for? or is it for your your your spouse, your children? What is it? Right? And then from that point on, you go to the strategic activity.
- [24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1470s) What can I do little by little every single day to build those wins and not go from 0 to 60 right away? Because you're going to fall off. That's why people fall off after the two weeks. They're not clear and they don't have the right strategy. Okay, next one. I get easily discouraged. One small step back and I'm convinced I'm just not good enough. That's mental toughness.
- [24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1493s) That's mental toughness, right? You got to be open to the fact that you're going to fail a little bit. And if you can be open to that and just know that not everything is going to work, you know, and that not good enough complex that comes from somewhere come from childhood, could could come from somebody you know, love and trust so much. It could come from a mom, it could come from a dad. But you have to dive into those things in order to fix that.
- [25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1514s) So being mentally tough and understanding like, hey, look, that's not my story. That's a story someone told me and I chose to subscribe to and believe and make it about me. That might could have been about them. So, I'm going to leave that there.
- [25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1532s) What can I do every single day to fix that? And it's it's really operate out of love for yourself. Everybody talks about you got to love yourself no matter what. I honestly and I get a lot of I don't believe that. I don't I don't love every version of myself. I don't. But I can have love for them, but I don't love the undisiplined Shawn. I don't love the Shawn that decides to sleep in and then eat like crap. Like I don't like that version of me.
- [25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1559s) But I can I can try to rectify that and transform that individual to who I am now out of a place of love, right? It's so funny. I used to this is this is kind of a side note, but my alarm clock used to say something aggressive. Wake up, whatever. You know, now it says I love you, Sean. I love you. And and so when my wife first saw the alarm clock, she goes, "Who wrote that?" I go, "I did.
- [26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1584s) " And she goes, "That doesn't sounds like that doesn't sound like something you would say about yourself." I was like, "Well, see, that's the problem because if I don't get here and see that every morning when I wake up and understand I'm operating and I'm getting up at 4:00 a.m. to go to the gym out of the fact that I love myself, then what am I ever going to become?" Yeah.
- [26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1604s) So it's like telling yourself a different story. But talking about that failure piece, a lot of people are just really stuck on fearing failure, just being so afraid of failure that that they don't just start. How can we reframe failure? Forget everything everybody's told you like literally.
- [27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1626s) So my wife did something very special for me back in 200 probably 17. I was having a very hard month at work and I was failing everywhere. And I was still a top performer, but from from my standards, I was just getting my butt kicked and my teeth kicked in every day. And she sent me this YouTube video and it was Will Smith, Justin Timberlake, and it was just this montage. You know what I'm talking about, those motivational montages.
- [27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1652s) And the first voice says, "Fail early, fail often, fail forward." That was Will Smith's voice. And so for me, I reframed my belief system on failure based on what that video was. I still have it saved. I still listen to it. You know, it's like you have to reframe what failure means.
- [27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1672s) And sometimes you have to go outside because you're not going to have the answer yourself. You got to you got to hear something or see something from people that you know everybody knows and that you respect because they've done so well and they're so successful. And so for me, that's what it was. It's just reframing by listening to that video and watching it over and over and over again until I believed it for myself.
- [28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1691s) I love that. Okay, next one. I've achieved so much on paper, but I still feel empty inside. Like I'm the same person just with better results. Oh, I think that's also I I that one's hard to define, right? That's hard to define the habit because I think that's all the habits mixed together, right? I I I believe that if you focus on the wrong thing, whether it's monetary or vanity, you're always going to feel empty no matter no matter how much you accomplish, right? You could say, "Okay, by this date, I want to make this much money." And then you get
- [28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1725s) there. Then you get there and it's you still feel empty. Retract. It's process. It's process. M the process if you really submit to a standard of what you need to do every single day and make the journey the goal and the win then when you get to that goal like you realize man I I'm empty because I didn't enjoy all this like this is where I live right now like the the journey of building this that's what I geek out on whatever goal I achieve however many li I remember when getting a million listens in a year was
- [29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1763s) like this monumental thing. And then when I got there, I was like, "Oh, shoot. What now?" It's cuz I didn't enjoy all this. Now we do. Now we do that plus 500,000 in a month. But I'm enjoying the struggle. I'm enjoying the process of building this show. So I think it's process. I love that.
- [29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1793s) You've got to enjoy the journey, not just a destination, because then the goalposts just keep moving and moving and moving and moving and you're never happy and it's never enough. So, I totally agree with that. Okay, last one here. I know what I want, but I keep procrastinating and waiting until I feel totally ready. When are you ever really ready? I'm not criticizing the question, but it's something that people need to really ask themselves.
- [30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1817s) Yeah, you're never going to be ready. I was never ready to leave corporate America and give up benefits and you know that big W2, right? So that's clarity in my opinion. Just being clear on what you want out of your life and what you want to give the world and if you feel you have a purpose.
- [30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1834s) So, I feel like my purpose is this and it was put it was given to me by God and I know how upset parents get when their kids don't use their gift. Well, I'm surely not going to squander the gift he gave me, right? That's the ultimate act of disrespect. So, for me, it's just understanding the clarity of like what is your purpose? And if it's your purpose and it's burning you, then you have to move forward.
- [31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1865s) And again, you don't have to go 0 to 60 and quit everything and and and burn the bridges right away because that would be irresponsible because sometimes you got to do what you don't want to do to do what you want to do full-time, right? So being clear on what it is that you are meant for and believing it and operating out of that that belief no matter what everybody else thinks.
- [31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1886s) So for your listeners, you might not ever be ready. You might not ever think it's the perfect time because the perfect time doesn't exist. There's always going to be challenges, but you got to you got to be able to move forward and get the most out of your life. What's your advice for people who feel like they can never get motivated and like they don't know how to motivate themselves? I think motivation is essential to kickstart some things.
- [31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1911s) You know, it it's the Kindle, it's the it's the pilot, right? But what you have to understand is the discipline and understanding what you need to do every day. That that's the real that's the real thing. I'm not motivated. I'm not That's the thing, you know, this mo
- [32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1929s) rning alarm clock goes off at 4:00 a.m. And that's just the time I choose to do it because if I don't do it, then I won't I won't get in the gym later cuz my life is busy. I'm never motivated to wake up at 4:00 a.m. and go to the gym when my body hurts and I'm exhausted, right? I I I'm never motivated to do that. But I said I was going to do it. So, I have to. I have to because you know the easiest word to break is to yourself. No one can see it.
- [32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1955s) No one knows if you're lying to yourself. You can have this whole conversation going on in your mind right now of why it's okay that you didn't get up and and read or send your emails or do whatever it or go for the walk. It doesn't matter if it's walk your dog. I don't care what it is. The moment you say you're going to do something, you don't do it.
- [32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1972s) You chip away at your at your confidence. Right? So that's how I feel. And and again, you don't want to think of it as like, oh my god, I'm a bad person because I didn't wake up today and go to the gym or or do whatever. There's going to be those days, right? But but to sit there and go, you know what? The mere fact that I'm not going to do something because I'm not motivated gives me zero joy. Like, why why are we waiting on the motivation because nothing will ever get done.
- [33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=1998s) The only thing I'm really motivated to do every day is hug my children, tell my wife I love her, and record shows. everything else I have to force myself to do. You know, this is an entrepreneurship show. A lot of my listeners are really interested in creator entrepreneurship. I think we have the dream job uh for a lot of people out there.
- [33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2020s) So, what are the different things that you're running in terms of revenue streams and and how are you bringing in revenue with your personal brand as a creator entrepreneur? Yeah, so right now we are obviously with the network. So, we're running ads, you know, we'll we'll start to do some 360 social campaigns. Uh, I help young podcasters in in the new in the business want to launch their show and and I take that as a very, you know, case by case basis because honestly, the last thing I want to do is be on coaching calls all day. I I really don't.
- [34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2047s) Um, but for those people that are truly driven to grow their show, you know, we we do build some good revenue with that because we give the actual value. It's not a cookie cutter thing. I'm the one doing the calls. I'm the one helping them set up their accounts. I'm the one teaching them what an RSS feed is. I'm the one teaching them what a good microphone is.
- [34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2065s) I'm the one teaching what a what a good direction of the show based on their belief system and based on what they want to give the world is. So yeah, and then I do go do speaking engagements. Uh I'm for hire and then I do get asked to go speak to, you know, medical sales teams and and teach them the things that we talked about today so they can perform better.
- [34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2089s) So, uh, for all the entrepreneurs tuning in, I know that you're also a sales expert. What's your best advice saleswise for everybody tuning in, like what are like some pointers that you want to give them or things that they should remember the next time they're going on a sales call? So, this is going to sound silly, all right? Because everybody wants to teach features and benefits, right? They look at my pamphlet. Look at my brochure. This is what this is. This is what it means to you.
- [35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2113s) No one cares about what these no one cares about how much you know until they know how much you care, right? So if you can show up as yourself, right? Because that company hired you for a reason. They liked your personality. But a lot of times they liked your skills, right? And they like your ability to communicate.
- [35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2132s) But a lot of times when people come into organizations, they go to the trainings and they hear everything that the train, you know, the the lead trainers are talking about and they feel like they have to have that same verbiage that that same energy and they change everything about them. They fall flat on their face cuz that's was happening to me.
- [35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2150s) So show up as you and show them how much you care. Find the problem. People think sales is selling something. It's solving a problem. And if you can solve a problem for somebody, whether it's payroll, whether it's medical, whether it's podcasting, whether it's a roof, a roofing company, it doesn't matter.
- [36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2175s) If there's a pain point and you can respectfully solve it and they like you, they're going to buy. Great. So, I also know Jade, uh, do you wake up, how how early do you wake up? Are you an early riser? 4:00 a.m. 4:00 a.m. Why do you wake up at 4:00 a.m.? Because the day gets going, right, and things happen, stress happens, and if I don't do the one thing that I know makes me a better person and operate on camera and on the microphone better, which is being in good physical condition and eating well, if I don't do that first thing in the mo
- [36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2204s) rning at 4:00 a.m., I'll say, "I'll do it later." And I won't. M and that happens again the next day and the next day and the next day and then 25 lbs later and and 6 months later I'm you know this version of myself that I don't like. So for me that's why I get up at 4:00 a.m. and go.
- [37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2228s) So I don't know about you but for me the most important thing for me to make sure that I have good interviews is making sure I get good sleep. That is definitely the most important thing. And so I make sure that I never do anything crazy the night before an interview and that I'm like in routine and anytime I've ever tried like and I end up not having good sleep, it's like something that I totally regret.
- [37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2253s) So what are some of the things that you do to ensure that you're at like peak performance when it comes to your interviews? I eat whole foods. All right. I get good sleep, decent sleep, six, seven hours a night and and I work out and then all the decisions leading up to the actual interviews, I'm preparing obviously, right, for my guest. I have a good idea of what they do and my show is very open format. We just have great conversation and it's very natural.
- [37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2277s) So for me, as long as I'm sharp, I don't drink alcohol very often. I mean, probably twice a year. And it's not because I'm this guy that doesn't believe in alcohol. just doesn't work for me. I don't metabolize it well.
- [38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2294s) So, I'll wake up, if I have two beers, I'll wake up groggy the next day and I'm not having this great conversation like I'm having with you. So, I try to keep my mind as clear as possible, right? I do have a great team. So, when I record something, my team does the clips, they post it for me, I have people do my engagement. So, I'm not tied to my screen. I'm not tied to a bunch of other things that are filling my mind with clutter.
- [38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2314s) And I feel energized. So that's just that's just kind of how I operate. At YAP, we have a super unique company culture. We're all about obsessive excellence and even call ourselves scrappy hustlers. My team is growing every day.
- [38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2331s) And luckily, when it comes to hiring, I no longer feel overwhelmed by the search for the perfect candidate because when it comes to hiring, Indeed is all you need. Stop struggling to get your post notice on job sites. Indeed sponsored jobs helps you stand out and hire fast by boosting your post to the top relevant candidates. Sponsored jobs on Indeed get 45% more applications than non-sponsored ones according to Indeed data.
- [39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2351s) I'm glad I found Indeed when I did because hiring is now so much easier than it used to be. In fact, in the minute I've been talking to you, 23 hires were made on Indeed, according to Indeed data worldwide. Plus, there's no subscriptions or long-term contracts with Indeed. You just pay for your results. There's no need to wait any longer.

- [39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2385s) Hiring Indeed is all you need. Hello young and profits. I know so many people out there and their workday wondering why certain tasks take forever and why they procrastinate or why they don't feel confident in their work. And that frustration can leave you feeling drained, unfulfilled, and burned out.
- [40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2402s) But here's the thing, that's not a character flaw. It's your natural wiring. And I learned that only after taking the working genius assessment created by Patrick Lencion, a legendary business influencer, entrepreneur, author. This assessment helps you identify the type of work you're actually built for and the work that you're not. And there's zero shame in that.
- [40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2422s) Once I took that assessment, I realized that my two strongest working geniuses are galvanizing and invention. And I'm meant to lead to rally people, inspire them, and invent. And those are the two core things that I should spend most of my time on. And my two frustrations are enablement and wonder. And so I don't like to wonder and vision too far off in the future. I like to just tackle what's ahead of me.
- [40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2445s) And so I released guilt and the frustrations that I had. and I instead elevated others like Kate and Jason in my organization to help me with the wonder and enablement piece. So, Working Genius helps you fill those gaps in your organization.
- [41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2464s) It takes about 10 minutes of your time and you get an assessment report that tells you your six working geniuses and whether it's a working genius, a competency, or a frustration. Now, this is not a personality test. This actually evaluates the way that you work. If you're an entrepreneur, a CEO, or somebody who wants to operate at your highest level, this assessment helps you double down on what you're naturally good at.
- [41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2481s) Take the Working Genius Assessment and get 20% off with code profiting at workinggenius.com. Again, that's workinggenius.com. Stop guessing. Start working in your genius. Um, speaking of some of these like mental patterns, you've said in the past thoughts are random, but thinking is not.
- [41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2505s) So, how can we make sure that we control our our mental patterns? And uh that's also about showing up as your best self because if I'm here and I'm thinking about, you know, some, you know, client or or something and and not present, it's going to mess up the interview. No. Sure.
- [42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2523s) So, I think that, you know, random thoughts, right? And I think the context around that quote was, you know, the you mentioned earlier like people that think I'm not good enough or I'm ugly or that person hates me. That's a random thought. Everybody's going to have these random negative thoughts. But true thinking is how you respond afterwards. Is it actually true? And if you feel it is true, okay, what's the evidence? What are the examples of why I'm not good enough? Explain that.
- [42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2546s) Right? And then you have this dialogue with yourself. And after a while, you go, "Wait a second. I've done this. I've done that. I've done this. I've done the other thing. I am good enough." Right? And so you just have to work yourself through those moments. Like random thought, it's okay.
- [42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2564s) You know, negative thinking is believing that that random thought and letting it perpetuate the rest of your day in your life. There's a big difference there. There's a big gap. Okay. So, as we close out this interview, I want to talk to you about networking. So, you just mentioned earlier that you had Jay Leno on the show, which is huge, and you've got some really big names that have come on your show.
- [43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2584s) So, what what are you doing these days to have a really high value network? What are some of the things that you do? I have secret weapons. What's that? No, I have a great publicist, Val Zucker. Oh, nice. She's amazing. She's, you know, and again, it's something that, you know, like a lot of us, See, that's the authenticity part of it, right? A lot of people say, "Well, I don't just I just I just send DMs. I just show up." And like, no, no, no, no, no.
- [43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2609s) I built a whole team, right? I built a whole team to support me, to help me grow my brand, improve my image, and it's everybody in the background doing amazing work, even down to my production team that that creates amazing visuals and clips and gets everything out on time, spends times on my partner does the show notes and he does the graphics for the the YouTube thumbnail and the and the, you know, the the cover.
- [43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2633s) Like all these things are working and these people are helping me grow this thing. So everything put together, but but really it was about, you know, me trusting somebody and knowing that I needed publicity, knowing that I needed news media, knowing that I needed all these things. And there was a time where I was just wearing a hat on my show and I was wondering why I wasn't going anywhere, right? And there was no brand.
- [44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2652s) It was a cool podcast. It was neat. It was it was a hobby. But the moment that I changed my image and changed how I operated in my discipline day-to-day, investors came, partners came and it all started to work together and then it gave me the opportunity to go, okay, now now I can go find a great publicist.
- [44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2677s) So you mentioned earlier how you know you started with really low-level equipment. I know Jenna Kutcher, I have a podcast network. I don't know if you know that. So Jenna Kutcher is in my podcast network. She started recording in her car with no microphone. I two years into podcasting interviewed Matthew McConna in my mother's basement. And so like you know everybody thinks like this is some overnight success that you need to have all this money to pump into equipment but you have a really great like origin story where you weren't even like you know entrepreneur or anything when you started. You quit corporate you were in your 40s. you got
- [45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2710s) started and just built brick by brick to become where you are today. So just walk us through like what were some of the big milestones in terms of like how you started and then like you know for me it's like I had a volunteer team of 20 people and like I just kept like leveling up.
- [45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2729s) What was your journey like? Yeah. So and thank you for that. Yeah. The origin story of the determined society also started like Jenna Kutchers. It was in my car right I had an iPhone. I was talking into it. some of the milestones. Well, the first milestone was recording that show. And it went something like this. Hi, this is Sean the Determined Society.
- [45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2745s) I don't know if anybody's going to listen. I hope you do. And if you do, I hope you like it. I just went through and I just had no plan. And then the next day, I was, you know, combing through and Apple podcast and I noticed that my show was on Apple. I was like, "Wow, that that for me was a big moment, right? M it it wasn't, you know, burning the world down, but I'm like, "Oh my gosh, how did I how do I have an Apple podcast?" I didn't even know how it worked.
- [46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2771s) Had no idea. So, that was a big milestone for me. And then when I learned that I could upload video to Ankor, I started doing Zoom interviews, right? And they were terrible. Like, I couldn't even figure out how to like, why would I ever hit record before someone came in? Why would I ever do it? I did and so like it was clunky and but but you know and then I had Andy Fcell's co-host uh DJ on then I had Larry Hagner on from the data edge podcast and then it started giving me this this belief system that I could get cool people on and have good interviews but I mean
- [46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2809s) another small milestone was when I print this is going to this is you're going to laugh. I printed off the original logo of the determined society which was a word cluster for crying out loud. Paula, a word cluster so bad. And I put it in a frame from CVS or Walgreens. I can't remember which one.
- [47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2831s) And then I got the 3M the 3M tape, the double-sided tape, and I just like official. This is dope. Look at this thing, man. And I look back at it and I just want to throw up. But that was a milestone for me, right? So there's many milestones that I look back on that mortified me then, but now I'm very proud of because the audience has been able to see my my growth, my stages, right? So starting off like having everything, it's not necessarily a good thing. I think you need to want a little bit. I think you need to get your butt
- [47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2861s) kicked a little bit because then you can really appreciate this industry as you know that is very hard. Well, talk to us about the team you built over this journey. Like what was the first thing you outsourced? What was the first thing you invested in? Well, the first thing I outsourced was editing, right? I would pay somebody like a hundred, you know, bucks an episode and then I was like, "Wow, this is expensive." Right? And my wife's like, "Hey, wait a second here. You're spending 400, 500 bucks on editing."
- [48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2887s) This was at the very beginning. I outsourced it. And then, you know, before it was monetizing, you know, I was taking the family income and doing that. I'm like, "Wait a second. I need to learn how to edit myself so I can get my show out and not take away from my kids, right? So, because I didn't want I didn't want to do that.
- [48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2906s) I didn't want to be selfish with it. That was the first thing I outsourced. And then I started outsourcing, you know, things like, you know, graphic design, things like that and uh distribution and then I went back to editing and uh and then finally production, right? in production was, you know, my my first goaround wasn't the greatest, but my team now, they kill it for me. They move mountains for me.
- [48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2936s) So, uh, and then it was PR and then, you know, some social media engage, not engagement, but more social media um, management, right? Like I I that's something I I want to talk to you about actually, but it's it's something that I don't want to do, right? And so those are all little things that I've outsourced and pretty much everything, you know, I would say mostly other than the back-end conversations with Valerie, my partners, that was another big thing.
- [49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2969s) Reena and Brad Miller, Pat Sickens, Roman Gaye, my wife's involved, you know, without my partners, like I would be a hot mess. I truly would, you know. So instead of being prideful of like I own this 100%. Yeah. 100% of zero is still zero. Yeah.
- [49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=2992s) It's true. You know. Yeah. So those are all the things that we've outsourced, right? And to the point now where you know how it works. I don't even I don't even hunt for my own campaigns anymore, right? Like we have people doing that and and it's great because then I can focus on this. Yeah.
- [50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3012s) But to your point, it's important like I feel that you are probably a better podcaster because you were hands-on in the beginning. You did edit your own stuff in the beginning and uh so you probably have a lot more empathy with your team and like understand what they're doing and also can help direct them better because you were hands-on from the start. So I think there's an advantage with that. It was just it's tactical.
- [50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3029s) It's a tactical business, right? it I think it doing all those things to your point at the very beginning made me better right it made it it helped me grow exponentially because if you look at it like you know four years in and we're doing the numbers that we're doing with no marketing like I still haven't pushed the button on marketing I it's something that we would I know right I know she's like dang it she see Danny See Danny's watching he's like you're you're you're in a sales pitch right now and I and I and I'm here for
- [51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3060s) it. I love it because the bottom line is without a real integrated marketing plan or any type of get the word out, right? It's hard to grow. So, I've been blessed. I'm I'm fortunate. Sean, I end my interview with two questions that I ask all of my guests. The first one is one what is one piece of actionable advice our young and profiters can take today to be more profitable tomorrow? I would say know the thing that you want to do and why, right? Because I I think it's very basic. It's so basic and it just like
- [51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3095s) the people are probably listening like is he really just saying that? But they're saying it and it triggers them because they they're not doing it right. Why do you really want to do the social media business? Why do you want to do podcasting? Why do you want to go sell cars? You have to have some type of passion around why you're doing it because it's going to be hard. It's you're gonna get you're gonna get your your teeth kicked in a little bit.
- [52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3120s) I said it that a few times today, but it's true. You're not going to always be successful in every single moment. So, you have to understand that this is going to be difficult and is the struggle worth it for me? And if you don't want to go through that struggle, you probably shouldn't be going do that thing.
- [52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3138s) So, find what you want to do and know the reason why you want to do it and be clear on it. and then make a plan. Don't listen to anybody. Don't listen to anybody that hasn't done what you're trying to do or been very successful at it. I'm sorry. It's just It's just the way it is. It's true. People could love you so much and give you terrible advice speaking from their own insecurities.
- [52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3159s) Absolutely. So, the last question is, what is your secret to profiting in life? And this can go beyond business and financial. just like what do you feel like is the recipe for success in life? The recipe or what does it look like? So the I mean the recipe is just staying in my process, you know, just what I wrote in the book. If I can stick to that, then I know I know I'm in a good spot.
- [53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3184s) You you have to be a lifelong learner as well. By no means do I think I have it figured out. Trust me, there's many shows of mine that I listen back to. I'm like, "Dude, you could have done better there." Like there was a question you could have gone deeper with. you can be better, Sean. So, I'm always open for feedback and I think people should always be open for feedback, especially successful people because there's always somebody more successful than you. But for me, when I look at the total enrichment of life, right? I look at am
- [53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3211s) I a success? Does my wife and my children feel safe? Tell me their feelings. That's it. That has to be an astounding yes. And it's not always a yes, right? Because we're human beings. We mess up a little bit at times. We don't have the right reactions to things.
- [53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3231s) But as long as I handle my process, handle the things that I need to, and that my family feels safe and expressing to me, that is that is everything to me. Why is it so important that that that your family feels like they can express to you and your family feels safe? Like, why is that so important to you? It's a great question. Cuz I didn't have it. I didn't have it. You know, I had I had parents that love me, my mom. I have a great relationship with my mom.
- [54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3253s) But you know, hey, you know, some people have, you know, more emotional capabilities to be there for people. And, you know, I I grew up, like I said, you know, the first eight, nine years without a father figure, right? So, for me, it was just there was times where I wasn't feeling seen and heard and understood.
- [54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3270s) And so, I just I always told myself like, I'm going to be the exact opposite. And I'm not slamming my mom. I'm not. I love that woman. Love you, mom. Like, it's not that. It's just the reality of it. She had her own childhood that she's still healing from, right? She never got through it because the family sheltered her from the reality and they didn't allow her to grow, right? They they masked it.
- [54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3296s) And so, how could she ever, you know, have the tools to be there for me in those certain moments that I needed cuz I didn't even know what I needed. So, that that's the reason why I just didn't have that. H any last words for the 60 to 80,000 young entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs that are going to listen to this episode? Enjoy the ride.
- [55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3321s) Like literally, literally enjoy the ride because there's not too many people that are going to do what you are trying to do. See all these entrepreneurs, the 80,000 of them listening right now, they think their reality is everybody else's reality. The reality truly is is what you're doing is scary. What you're doing is hard. And there's not a whole lot of people that are that are sitting there banking on your success.
- [55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3341s) They're waiting for the phone call for you to fail. So don't ever give them the opportunity to receive that phone call. Dig in hard. Understand why you're doing it and never come off of it. Because at the end of the day, my biggest fear and I and I would hope that most people fear this is being on my deathbed wishing I would have done more, wishing I would have chased my dream, wishing I would have enacted a little bit more strategy.
- [56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3365s) You're not going to be worried like, well, I had this car, had this amazing house. You're going be like, did I do everything? Did I do everything that I wanted to? And so, as long as you stay true to that and keep that at the forefront of your mind every day, how the hell are you going to lose? H I love that, Sean. Uh this was such a great conversation.
- [56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3384s) Where can everybody learn more about you and everything that you do? Well, thank you for that. I had a blast. Uh you can go to the determinedocciety.com, right? That's the website. Um we're on Spotify at the determined society. Same with Apple and uh Instagram is the Sean French. And you know, I'm pretty easy to pretty easy to get to know. I'm I'm pretty approachable.
- [56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3402s) Awesome. Well, thank you so much for joining us on Young and Profiting Podcast. Thanks for having me. All right, Yap gang. I hope you got a lot out of my conversation with Shawn French. He is yet another example of somebody who turned deep adversity into unstoppable drive.
- [57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3421s) Shawn went from breaking down his truck paralyzed by fear and self-doubt to becoming a top 1% salesperson, a powerful speaker, and a creator who built the determined society from the ground up. What I love about Shawn's story is how simple yet profound his turnaround really was. He didn't find success through luck or magic.
- [57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3440s) He found it through clarity, preparation, and discipline. When he realized he was failing because he wasn't prepared, he didn't make excuses. He started planning his days down to the zip code, logging every single action and executing with intention. That structure became the blueprint for his unstoppable process and the foundation for everything he's built since.
- [57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3460s) Shawn also reminded us that authenticity is everything. People don't buy products, they buy people. Whether you're in sales, leadership, or building a personal brand, showing up as your true self with empathy and consistency is what earns trust and drives connection.
- [57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3479s) The moment Sean stopped trying to sound like everyone else and just showed up as himself, his career exploded. And one of my favorite takeaways was his idea that discipline beats motivation every time. Motivation fades. But keeping your promises to yourself builds confidence and that confidence compounds into success. Every rep you do at 4 a.m.
- [58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3498s) , every time you follow through when nobody else is watching, you're proving to yourself that you can be trusted. So, if you're waiting for that perfect moment to start that project, pivot your career, or share your story, remember Shaun's words. You'll never feel ready. Move anyway. The process itself is where the growth and motivation happens. Yap fam.
- [58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcZWMQ_UL2o&t=3517s) If you listen, learned, and profited from this episode with Shawn, share it with a friend who's ready to become unstoppable, too.
